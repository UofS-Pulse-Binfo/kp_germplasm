# DEPRECATED: No Longer needed for Tripal 3

This module is Tripal 2 specific. It is no longer needed for Tripal 3 which supports different page display and add/edit forms for different types of germplasm. The Tripal 3 solution is to customize field order and presence through the admin UI. Tripal D3 combined with tripal Fancy fields still provide the pedigree diagram.

### KnowPulse Germplasm

This module extends the Tripal stock module for more intuitive support of germplasm including both custmoization of the stock add/edit form and page display. The TripalD3 module also provides a pedigree diagram that compliments this module well.
